                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Starbucks is a popular American coffee chain that operates on a global scale. The Seattlebased business was established in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker.
                    Starbucks has expanded from its original 1971 location in Seattle to include more than 30,000
                    retail outlets throughout 83 markets. Over the years, Starbucks has been recognised for its
                    high-quality coffee, trendy and pleasant locations, and exceptional customer service. The
                    selection of baked goods, teas, and other consumables offered by the company has expanded.
                    In this research, I present and examine the ways in which Starbucks might use data science
                    and AI to expand their business and enhance profits. How AI can help Starbucks attract and
                    retain more customers. With the use of AI, Starbucks can not only capitalise on the food
                    business but also address supply chain disruptions, cost management, and quality control
                    challenges. In this evaluation, I will focus on providing a detailed analysis and description of
                    four primary types of analysis methods.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data collection</li>
                  <li>Data management</li>
                  <li>Communication and Visualisation</li>
                  <li>Decision support.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Starbucks has over 31,000 locations in 82 countries, making it the largest coffeehouse chain
                    in the globe. The company's success has been driven by its emphasis on quality, customer
                    experience, and corporate responsibility, which includes initiatives such as the ethical sourcing
                    of coffee beans and the reduction of its ecological footprint. Effective inventory management
                    is essential for Starbucks keep up with client demand and prevent surpluses. Predicting
                    demand and optimising inventory levels with AI-powered inventory management solutions
                    may help Starbucks cut down on stockouts and waste. Starbucks has made substantial
                    investments in digital technology over the years to improve
                    the customer experience, expedite operations, and gain customer behaviour insights. In order
                    to contend with their primary rivals like Dunkin' Donuts, Peet's Coffee, Caribou Coffee and Tim
                    Hortons. They have already implemented the following digital transformation initiatives:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mobile Ordering and Payment</li>
                  <li>Digital Rewards and Loyalty Programs</li>
                  <li>Digital Menu Boards</li>
                  <li>Data Analytics and AI</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Starbucks uses data analytics and AI to understand customer behaviour and improve
                  operations. AI optimises its supply chain and ensures product availability. Starbucks' digital
                  transformation has improved the customer experience, streamlined operations, and yielded
                  consumer behaviour insights. Focusing on digital technology has allowed the company to
                  remain ahead of the competition and maintain its leadership position in the coffeehouse
                  industry. It also employs data analytics to personalize the consumer experience and make
                  recommendations based on customer preferences. The key to efficient manufacturing and
                  minimal waste for Starbucks is precise demand forecasting. In order to effectively forecast
                  demand, AI systems may examine past data, external factors like weather and events, and
                  other variables. Quality assurance means making sure all of Starbucks goods and services are
                  of the same high standard. Quality concerns may be proactively addressed with the use of AIpowered systems by analysing data from several sources, such as customer feedback and
                  product testing.</p>
                <h3>Data Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                                    For the purpose of producing a holistic assessment of the company's performance and
                  informing strategic decision-making, a full analysis of Starbucks would require a combination
                  of data pertaining to the company's finances, customers, markets, and operations, as well as
                  social media. The management of data in a large organisation may be a difficult undertaking;
                  however, there are a number of actions that can be done to ensure that data is managed
                  appropriately and utilised in an efficient manner. The following are some important measures
                  that should be taken:
                  Create a data management strategy. The goals of the company's data management as well as
                  the policies and procedures for collecting, storing, and using data should be outlined in this
                  strategy. Starbucks needs to determine all of the internal sources that contribute to the data
                  that is generated. This comprises social media channels, point of sale (POS) systems, as well
                  as platforms for customer relationship management (CRM). In addition to this, the
                  management and use of data needs to be governed by a set of procedures, standards, and
                  norms.
                  The storage of data should be centralised since this will help ensure that it is handled
                  appropriately and is easily accessible to those who require it. This is something that can be
                  accomplished by data warehouses or by other types of centralised data storage systems. This
                  should comprise storage that is located on the business's premises, storage that is located in
                  the cloud, or a hybrid solution that mixes the two. They have the option of utilising industryleading cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, or Microsoft Azure.
                  Data Requirements
                  When it comes to the data, security is an essential component to take into consideration.
                  Companies that lack an adequate security system leave themselves open to attack by third
                  parties, which in turn provides an opportunity for their rivals to gain a market share
                  advantage. Should create access controls to guarantee that only authorised individuals
                  have access to the data, since data security prevents important firm data from being
                  compromised. Utilising role-based access control, two-factor authentication, and
                  encryption are all potential components of this measure.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Analysis Problems</h3>
                <p>Due to poorly managed data, the Starbacks have featured numerous examples in recent years.
                  Over time, expansion into new markets and the opening of new stores contributed
                  significantly to the company's overall growth. Due to the company's rapid growth, there has
                  been a dramatic increase in the amount of data it must store and manage. It can be
                  challenging for organisations to manage such a large amount of data if they do not have
                  efficient data management systems in place. Before any breach occurred, they had not done
                  enough to ensure the safety of the data and its confidentiality. During this time, there were
                  multiple reports of data breaches due to lack of security. Customers' trust in the company will
                  be eroded as a result of these issues, which will have a major effect on the company's
                  reputation. In recent years, Starbucks has experienced the following real-world data issues.
                  Below are the real world example for the data problems when unable to manage the data.
                  In 2015, customers of Starbucks reported incidences of gift card fraud, in which the cash on
                  their gift cards were depleted without their knowledge or agreement. It is thought that
                  hackers gained access to users' accounts through the Starbucks mobile app, which led to the
                  fraudulent purchase of gift cards. After then, the hackers were able to move money from the
                  gift cards of other customers to their own accounts, effectively stealing the money.(Fox, 2015)
                  Inaccurate sales forecasting: In 2018, Starbucks overstated its sales projection, which led to a
                  reduction in the growth rate of sales. Because sales projections were not met, the value of the
                  company's stock dropped by more than nine percent, as stated in an article published by
                  CNBC. (Kate Rogers, 2018)
                  Starbucks Coffee Korea Co was given a fine of 10 million won (about $9,000) by South Korea's
                  communications authority as a result of the company's disclosure of the personal information
                  of hundreds of its customers.(Starbucks fined US$9,000 for Korea personal data breach, 2018
                  )</p>

            <section id="Discussion">
                <h2>Data collection</h2>
                <p>The process of acquiring data is essential to research because it opens the way for the
                  collection of high-quality data that can then be analyzed and used to draw conclusions and
                  make decisions based on accurate information. According to the goal of collecting data is to
                  get rid of the problem of "data islands." No matter what kind of data it is—structured,
                  unorganized, or discrete—without data collection, data from different sources can only be
                  separate and useless. Data capture is the process of putting these data into the data centre,
                  putting together the scattered data, and then analysing these data in depth. Based on how big
                  data sources are categorised, data collection can be broken down into different groups. (Li,
                  2021) Few of them are listed as below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Collection of system file log : Analysis of system log files is a common method of system administration. These
                    include asynchronous data collecting, temporal peculiarities in data representation,
                    and the use of varying message lengths and formats for reporting data.(Wei et al.,
                    2005)</li>
                  <li>Network big data collection : Web data collection is the process of gathering information about the web using
                    means such as web crawlers and open application programming interfaces. This
                    technique is able to collect and organise previously unstructured material found on
                    the web and save it to a single local file. It allows for the storage of media like photos,
                    videos, and audio files, and they may be linked to their respective bodies instantly.(Li,
                    2021)</li>
                  <li>
                    Software program access : In order to better understand various facets of a company, organisation, or system, it
                    can be helpful to collect data for analysis using software. Because the data is collected
                    through software, businesses have complete freedom to tailor the process to their
                    specific needs. This gives them control over both the data and the software they use.
                    However, software analysis requires meticulous planning, the selection of suitable
                    software tools, and an eye for data quality and pre-processing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide database and data file : Data file data, Database records and data stored in a dataset
                  </li>
                  <li>Discrete data or random data selection</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Data management</h3>
                <p>The act of arranging, storing, safeguarding, and sustaining data during its entire existence is
                  referred to as its "lifecycle." It entails a wide variety of practices and actions with the goal of
                  guaranteeing the usefulness, accessibility, and safety of the data. The process of processing
                  data inside an enterprise is known as data management, and it involves both the technological
                  and organisational components of this process. Data governance, data quality, data
                  integration, data storage and infrastructure, data security and privacy, data lifecycle
                  management, metadata management, and data access and provisioning are some examples
                  of the other types of management.</p>
                <p>Companies that manage power grids, thanks to advances in "big data" technology and the
                  rapid development of "smart grids," have amassed a large amount of data, and it's not only
                  data generated by the power grid itself. The planning and operation of the electrical grid is
                  also heavily influenced by many extraneous factors, such as the economy, society, government
                  regulations, climate, user attributes, geographic location, etc. Data comes in numerous forms,
                  including the organised and unstructured varieties as well as the real-time, near-real-time,
                  and historical varieties. This complicates data management and mining. (F et al., 2020)</p>
                <h3>Communication and Visualisation</h3>
                <p>The ability to effectively communicate and visually display data is a crucial part of any data.
                  They entail laying down information in a way that's easy to digest, so that others may share
                  and learn from it. Data-driven decision-making, cooperation, and the ability to understand
                  complex information are all aided by effective data communication and visualization in the
                  workplace. If the information is presented in a style that is both aesthetically appealing and
                  easy to understand, users will be able to quickly absorb the most important insights and make
                  well-informed judgements. Visualization Technology: Commonly, statistical graphics and data
                </p>
                <p>visualisation are regarded as relatively recent developments. Formulating a research question, collecting data, cleaning
                  the data, selecting a chart type and tool, preparing data, and ultimately constructing a chart
                  are the most fundamental steps in data visualisation. In today's data-driven corporate
                  environment, data visualisation is crucial, and it has been extensively used to assist decisionmaking that is closely linked to the key revenue streams of many industrial
                  companies.(Muskan et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2005)</p>
                <p>Data communication: To make sure your data visualisation helps your audience reach the idea
                  or conclusion you want them to, communication should be clear and thoughtful. Data science
                  workers are working together more and more on big projects before sharing their thoughts
                  with a wider audience through visualisation. work has modelled how data science teams,
                  which often have different jobs and ways of working, share their knowledge with outside
                  stakeholders. (Pang et al., 2022)</p>
                <h3>Decision support</h3>
                <p>Decision support in data science assists organisations and people in making decisions that are
                  better informed and driven more by data by integrating approaches from data science with
                  domain expertise. It is helpful in a wide variety of decision-making domains, including
                  corporate strategy, resource allocation, risk assessment, process optimisation, and many
                  more. These domains span many different sectors.</p>
                <p>For instance, since evidence-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) typically make
                  objective judgements based on clinical data, ignoring patient preferences. A problem that
                  needs to be thought about now is how to give a particular patient the best and most
                  personalised medical plan. We suggest using patient experience data and clinical guidelines
                  to provide evidence to assist patient-oriented clinical decision-making.(Wu & Xiao, 2021)</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence has greatly improved data analysis for decision-making during the past
                  decade. The subject of artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly expanding, and now focused on
                  enhancing decision-making procedures by utilising cutting-edge AI approaches and tackling
                  difficulties such as interpretability, fairness, and ethical concerns. Traditional assistant
                  decision-making models have long decision-making times and sluggish convergence. Big data
                  mining technology uses artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly find hidden useful
                  information in complicated and multi-scale enormous data. Based on the original "six

                <h2>Critical Analysis and Evaluation of the Applications of the Techniques</h2>
                <h3>Data collection at Starbucks</h3>
                <p>As the first and most crucial stage in any endeavour, data collection is the process of gathering
                  and evaluating information about customers, transactions, and other pertinent data points
                  inside Starbucks locations and digital platforms. Point-of-sale systems, smartphone
                  applications, loyalty programmes, and internet interactions are just some of the common
                  methods through which this information is collected. While collecting consumer data can yield
                  useful insights, businesses like Starbucks must safeguard the privacy of their customers'
                  information and adhere to all relevant legislation. Methods of acquiring preliminary data are
                  illustrated below.
                  Starbucks point-of-sale (POS) system keeps track of the item(s) purchased, the total price, and
                  the method of payment. Information on a purchase might include what was purchased, when
                  it was purchased, and how much was paid. This data can shed light on the most popular
                  products, pricing trends, and overall business activity.
                  Starbucks Rewards, their customer reward programme, is very well-liked. Customers' coffee
                  purchases may be monitored using the Starbucks app. Starbucks' precise food and drink
                  suggestions are the result of the application of the cloud-based artificial intelligence engine
                  Digital Flywheel. (Pakapol, 2023)
                  Use the Starbucks mobile app to place an order, add special touches, and pay on the go. The
                  programme records the user's movements, purchases, and current location. Customised
                  advertisements, shop recommendations, and regional consumer behaviour data are just a few
                  examples of how the Starbucks Mobile App might use a user's device's location.</p>
                <h3>Data management at Starbucks</h3>    
                <p>It's not just Starbucks Consolidated big data storages hold and draw data from several
                  distributed databases that are maintained by the various dispersed business units, which is
                  useful for making company-wide management decisions. (Milosevic et al., 2021) Due to its
                  outdated technology, organizations confront various issues handling large financial data.
                  Point-of-sale (POS) systems, mobile applications, consumer feedback, loyalty programmes,
                  and social networking platforms are just some of the sources they've previously adopted for
                  data collecting. Also, for the records keeping Starbucks certainly makes use of a powerful data
                  storage system to manage the massive amounts of data it receives. Data such as customer
                  profiles, transaction records, inventory records, and marketing campaign information may be
                  stored on-premises or in the cloud. Starbucks can better understand its overall performance
                  and pinpoint areas for improvement by combining data from many sources, including sales
                  figures, customer reviews, and details about the company's supply chain. Starbucks uses data
                  As the first and most crucial stage in any endeavour, data collection is the process of gathering

                  Data management at Starbucks
                  analytics to gain insight and direct business strategy. Understanding consumer behavior,
                  optimizing retail operations, and creating focused marketing campaigns may need a
                  combination of descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Machine learning
                  and data mining are only two examples of the kinds of advanced analytics techniques that may
                  be used to dig deeper into the data in search of previously unseen patterns and trends. Its
                  data management skills are put to use by the personalization and customer relationship
                  management (CRM) functions. Starbucks can better serve its customers by studying their
                  purchase, preference, and feedback data in order to provide individualised suggestions,
                  promotions, and rewards. Starbucks relies on effective supply chain management to keep its
                  items in stock at its shops throughout the world. Optimising stock levels, predicting sales,
                  checking on vendors, and optimising transport are all made easier with well-managed data.
                  A NoSQL database is the best option for the management of vast amounts of financial data
                  because it can handle enormous amounts of data in many forms. Hadoop-based financial data
                  cleansing, integration, and reduction enhance huge dataset processing speed and efficiency.
                  Clustering methods and MapReduce for financial big data analysis algorithms can analyse
                  processed data and anticipate user behaviour. (Chang & Wang, 2022)</p>
                <h3>Communication and Visualisation at Starbucks</h3>  
                <p>In data mining, data visualisation is essential for making sense of massive data sets. There are
                  a variety of proposed visualisation techniques, with t-distributed stochastic neighbour
                  embedding being considered state-of-the-art. (Lensen et al., 2021) There are several methods
                  that we can use to visualise our analysis for the resizable parties and the public to give a clear
                  idea about the predictions. So in case StartBucs can have market advantages with its
                  competitors from the market, As an example, Dashboad is one of the common methods to
                  demonstrate the analysis. Reporting and Dashboards may convey data visually and
                  conveniently. This helps stakeholders
                  track KPIs and performance indicators for data-driven decision-making. data visualisation
                  tools like charts, graphs, and maps. These visualisations help stakeholders comprehend
                  complicated data and spot trends. The effectiveness of decision-making and productivity in an
                  organization are both enhanced when users are pleased with the dashboards provided by
                  business intelligence (BI) systems. Cox also shows a correlation between training decision
                  quality and more dashboard usage; in other words, the higher the quality of the choice, the
                  more is needed.(Sánchez-Ferrer et al., 2019)
                  Starbucks may use data storytelling to tell stories. They may engage stakeholders and explain
                  concepts by mixing visuals, tales, and context. Also Collaborative Platforms may use to share
                  data insights and foster departmental conversations. These tools let stakeholders annotate,
                  explore, and draw insights in real time.
                  Communication and Visualisation at Starbucks
                  Presentations and Visual Communication also use at Starbucks may give facts and
                  recommendations. Charts, infographics, and data visualisations help convey information by
                  using the smart application they can derectly communicate with the customers for instance
                  the monthly coffee expensas and how many points he can add from the next month.</p>
                <h3>Decision support at Starbucks</h3>
                <p>Decision support is an integral part of Starbucks' data management practises, playing a critical
                  part in the company's efforts to leverage data insights to guide decision-making processes.
                  The ability to choose the best course of action is what we mean when we talk about decisionmaking.
                  Data-driven decisions made with the help of AI are now helping millions of people. Data
                  Driven Decision Making provides guidance on how to use data-driven decision-making
                  approaches for improved resource management across a variety of technical processes
                  involved in managing IoT system resources.(Kavitha & Chinnasamy, 2021) Strategic and
                  operational choices at Starbucks are likely influenced by data analysis and insights. This means
                  sorting through data in search of trends, patterns, and possibilities that may then be used to
                  guide decision-making at a variety of organisational levels.
                  It is possible that Starbucks will make use of techniques from predictive analytics in order to
                  anticipate future trends, customer behaviour, and market demand. They are able to create
                  educated forecasts that help decision-making, such as inventory management or product
                  introductions, by analysing historical data and utilising statistical models. Predictive analytics
                  systems must contain several ways for analysing and predicting time series to answer
                  corporate leaders' management challenges, especially while making managerial decisions.
                  Automated and software tools use forecasting methodologies categorised by the analytical
                  group based on source data attributes.(Romanenkov et al., 2020)
                  Many enterprises, from small-medium to large, value business intelligence systems (BIS).
                  There is much research on BIS acceptance, implementation, and key success factors (CSFs),
                  but less on BI software tool selection. (Gina & Budree, 2020) Starbucks may use business
                  intelligence for decision-making. These technologies aggregate, analyse, and visualise data,
                  giving stakeholders real-time access to KPIs, reports, and dashboards.</p>

                <h2>Critical Review of the Commercial and Open-source Software</h2>
                <h3>Software for Data collection</h3>
                <p>LabView Data collection, instrument control, and industrial automation are just few of the
                  many applications that make use of LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering
                  Workbench). Importantly is a is a licensed software that has to be learned before it can be
                  used to its full capacity. Through the use of compatible hardware and interfaces, LabVIEW may
                  be used to collect information from a wide range of sources, including Starbucks. Most classic
                  Data collection systems are utilised on fixed devices or situations. This sort of data gathering
                  system was typically more costly since each channel could only be linked to the sensor of the
                  original developed type and could not be applied to other comparable tests, making it difficult
                  to handle complicated testing system needs. Virtual instruments make data collecting systems
                  generic and software-oriented. Many LabVIEW-based testing systems exist. The adaptability
                  and autonomy of data collecting systems have increased. (Du et al., 2017) LabVIEW is
                  compatible with a large variety of sensors and equipment for data gathering. also
                  may be used to communicate with sensors that measure environmental conditions such as
                  humidity, pressure, and temperature in a Starbucks. Instrument Control facilitates interaction
                  and data exchange with devices like barcode scanners, scales, and Starbucks' coffee machines.
                  It's now possible to collect information from these gadgets to track production, inventories,
                  and sales. Because of the proliferation of IoT devices, LabVIEW may now be used to collect
                  data from those installed in Starbucks cafes. Internet-of-Things sensors might track things like
                  equipment health, energy use, or consumer traffic. Data may be continuously acquired and
                  stored with LabVIEW's real-time data logging capabilities. LabVIEW might be used at Starbucks
                  to keep track of readings from a wide range of sensors and devices over time for the purposes
                  of quality assurance and process improvement.. (LabVIEW Documentation, 2023)</p>

                  orchestrated with the aid of AWS Data Pipeline, while AWS Glue assists with data preparation
                  and transformation. AWS Glue Data Catalogue is a centralised metadata repository, and
                  Amazon Athena enables interactive querying of Amazon S3 data. When used together, the
                  AWS products provide Starbucks with a turnkey data management solution for streamlined
                  data storage, processing, analysis, and governance. Starbucks may improve its data-driven
                  skills and obtain useful insights by using these technologies.</p>
                <h3>Software for Communication and Visualisation</h3>
                <p>Power BI While there are numerous open-source, free software options available, none compares to the strength and versatility of power bi. Power BI's visualisation features let you easily transform your data into several visual representations, including but not limited to bar charts, column charts, pie charts, scatter plots, matrices, and scatter plots. Excel files, SQL Server datasets, comma-separated values (CSV), and many other formats are all supported by Microsoft Power BI. You'll also need to manually assemble a dataset. Power BI's transform data capability allows us to tailor the data to our needs. Power BI allows users to simultaneously update many sheets. Power BI's filter function adds a new dimension to data visualisation. In order to access data from its online repository, Power BI has a web function. (Singh et al., 2023) When it comes to Communication and visualising information, Microsoft Power BI may be a huge help to Starbucks. Power BI allows Starbucks to make dashboards and reports that are both engaging and informative, which improves the company's ability to share and explain Software for Communication and Visualisation complicated data. With the help of real-time reporting, Starbucks can keep tabs on crucial metrics and KPIs in order to make informed decisions and disseminate relevant data in a timely fashion. Power BI's collaborative capabilities encourage teams to work together by letting them create dashboards and reports simultaneously. To make sure that everyone has access to the most up-to-date information, Starbucks can also provide reports and dashboards to interested parties both inside and outside the company. Power BI's mobile apps allow workers to view dashboards and insights on the go, improving their ability to collaborate and make decisions. By allowing users to pose queries to data in natural language, Power BI facilitates both transparent communication and in-depth analysis. Starbucks' internal communication and cooperation is further improved by the integration of other Microsoft technologies such as Excel, SharePoint, and Teams. Overall, Power BI enables data-driven decisions throughout Starbucks by improving communication and data visualisation.</p>
